# Brainstorming: Making the Advent Layoff Calendar Funnier

## Sarcastic/Dark Humor Messaging
- Add corporate jargon euphemisms for layoffs like "rightsizing opportunity" or "career transition celebration"
- Replace "Advent Layoff Calendar" with something like "Holiday Headcount Reduction Extravaganza"
- Change "Bid on PTO" to "Vulture their remaining vacation days"
- Add "Claim their desk plant" or "Dibs on their ergonomic chair" buttons
- Change "Sign goodbye letter" to "Add a generic 'We'll miss you!' comment you don't mean"

## Visual Elements
- Add a corporate mascot like a cheerful grim reaper with a Santa hat
- Include a "Productivity score" that goes up after each layoff
- Show "Stock price impact" with a green arrow going up after each layoff
- Add a "carbon footprint reduction" counter as if layoffs are good for the environment
- Show the CEO's bonus increasing with each layoff

## Interactive Features
- Add a "survivor's guilt" meter that fills up as more colleagues are laid off
- Include "Excuse generator" for managers with phrases like "strategic realignment" or "focusing on core competencies"
- Add a "Layoff bingo" card with squares like "cried in bathroom," "LinkedIn status changed," "motivational post about new beginnings"
- Create a "Remaining employee workload calculator" that shows tasks being redistributed
- Add "Office pool betting" on who's next to go

## Modal Pop-up Ideas
- Show a "Career achievements" section that gets dramatically underplayed
- Add a "Years of service vs. seconds to pack belongings" comparison
- Include random "exit quotes" like "At least I don't have to attend the holiday party now!"
- Show humorous "alternate career suggestions" like "dog walker" or "influencer"
- Add "personal items forgotten" checklist (family photos, favorite mug, dignity)

## Calendar Day Themes
- Give each day a theme like "Finance Friday" or "Marketing Monday" where that department gets hit
- Add random "safe days" where nobody gets fired (but there's still anxiety)
- Include "Double Layoff Tuesday" where two people go instead of one
- Add special "Executive Golden Parachute" days where an executive leaves with a massive bonus
- Include "Remote Worker Purge" day where all remote employees are cut

## Sound and Animation Effects
- Add the "You're fired!" sound clip from The Apprentice
- Include sad trombone sound when revealing the day's layoff
- Add paper shredder sounds when people are removed
- Show employees being dragged off the screen when fired
- Add dramatic "zoom calls gone wrong" animations for the layoffs

## Extra Features
- Add a "severance calculator" that always shows a disappointingly low number
- Include an "office supplies theft recommendation" based on seniority
- Show "remaining employees' fear level" status bar
- Add a "reasons given vs. actual reasons" comparison chart
- Include a "time until your job is replaced by AI" countdown
